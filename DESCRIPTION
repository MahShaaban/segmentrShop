Description: Chromatin segmentation analysis transforms ChIP-seq data into 
    signals over the genome.  The latter represents the observed states in a 
    multivariate Markov model to predict the underlying (hidden) states of the
    chromatin. ChromHMM, written in Java, integrates histone modification 
    datasets to learn the chromatin states de-novo. We developed an R package 
    around this program to leverage the existing R/Bioconductor tools and data
    structures in the context of the segmentation analysis. segmentr wraps the 
    Java modules to call ChromHMM and captures the output in an S3 R object. 
    This allows for iterating with different parameters, which are given in R 
    syntax. Capturing the output in R makes it easier to work with the results 
    and to integrate them in downstream analyses. Finally, segmentr provides 
    additional tools to test, select and visualize the models. To sum, we 
    developed an R package to wrap a popular chromatin segmentation tool and 
    capture the output in R for testing and visualization. In this demo, a 
    brief introduction of semgnetation analysis and ChromHMM in particlare 
    will be given. Then we will use the segmentr packaged to apply the 
    analysis to a test dataset and explore the output. We will focus on 
    iterating over models with diffferent numbers of to select one the fits 
    the data well and visualizing the results
